# PA_1_fitbit_data
Programming Assignment for CptS 122 at WSU
<br> Instructor: Andrew O'Fallon <br>
 <br>  In this assignment, we analyze data that was generated from Fitbit devices.
 The data is stored in a comma-separated values (.csv) file ( from an actual fitbit, however I used a smaller sample file for program testing)<br>
 <br>The entries in this file were merged from two different devices. 
 <br> Important learning outcomes:
<br>- dedupe any entries that appear multiple times and perform data cleansing on any entries that have missing fields.
<br>- Parse each line of .csv data as a string, discarding any that do not belong to the target patient
<br> <br>
